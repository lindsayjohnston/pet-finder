#Pet-finder Site

This site mimics the styling and functionality of the Petfinder website. I used React to create dynamically-populated content cards to showcase each animal on the website. The site is fully responsive and easily scales to any amount of animals added to the database. It allows the user to filter through animals based on type and add favorites to a list of "faves" for future perusal.
